## Required Packages
Written in `python2.7`. <br>
Python packages `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels` are needed.


## Code
### student_changepoint.py
This is the main file for student change detection.
It loads a matrix with size (`n_students X n_days`) in csv format and runs the changepoint detection.
Take a look the main function at the bottom for an example run (or you can just run this file).

* __Class `StudentChangepoint`__<br>
`detected_cp_arr`: detected changepoint locations<br>
`mcp_max_ll_mat`, `m0_ll_mat` : LogLik values for model w/ cp and model w/o cp<br>
`mcp_min_bic_mat`, `m0_bic_mat` : BIC values for model w/ cp and model w/o cp<br>
`alpha_i_mat` : Three column matrix for alpha_i's. `[alpha_i1, alpha_i2, alpha_i0]`<br>
`better_w_cp_sidxs` : Student indices with detected change<br>
`better_wo_cp_sidxs` : Student indices without detected change<br>

### glm_gd.py
Generalized linear regression using a simple gradient descent method (that only works for our model).
This code is used for the Bernoulli model only. (`statsmodels` package is used for the Poisson model.)

### utils.py
Some useful functions that are being used.
